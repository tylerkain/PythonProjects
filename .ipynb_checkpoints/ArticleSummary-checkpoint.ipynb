It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/west-virginia-google-facebook-newspaper-lawsuit/2021/02/03/797631dc-657d-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">local news outlets crater</a> and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”</p></div><div><h3 class=\"font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod\">Building a persuasion machine</h3></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known.

Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print dn db-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print db dn-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">According to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia.

Accompanying the Facebook page is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/05/facebook-says-private-groups-are-its-future-some-are-hubs-misinformation-hate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_46\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">private group</a> called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print db dn-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print dn db-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the <a href=\"https://www.donorstrust.org/resilience/\" title=\"www.donorstrust.org\">announcement</a> from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The news site, which is among a growing number of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courier-newsroom-complaint-fec/2020/09/02/afa2305c-ed2e-11ea-ab4e-581edb849379_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_56\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">journalistic initiatives</a> undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project. In the March 1 email to Stephens, Rasmussen was identified as the project’s executive director. She declined to comment on the project.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">“It’s Potemkin politics,” said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “It raises deception to an art form, and it aids in the de-democratization of media and of public life.”</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md bold\" data-el=\"text\">\n",

It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/west-virginia-google-facebook-newspaper-lawsuit/2021/02/03/797631dc-657d-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">local news outlets crater</a> and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”</p></div><div><h3 class=\"font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod\">Building a persuasion machine</h3></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print dn db-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print db dn-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">But the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/16/cancel-culture-blends-into-victim-culture/?itid=lk_inline_manual_27\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">cancel culture</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/23/tim-scott-woke-supremacy-intolerance/?itid=lk_inline_manual_27\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">woke supremacy</a>.”</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print dn db-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print db dn-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">According to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.</p></div><div><div style=\"min-height:491px\"></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print db dn-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24 million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print dn db-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">The arrangement illustrates why <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">politically aligned nonprofits</a> have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.</p></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”</p></div><div><h3 class=\"font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod\">Driving engagement</h3></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">Communications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.</p></div><div><div class=\"relative cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pt-md pb-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print db dn-ns\" data-qa=\"article-body-ad\" style=\"min-height:600px\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"absolute z-0\" style=\"left:50%;top:50%\">AD</div></div></div><div><p class=\"font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md\" data-el=\"text\">Mighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTitled Arise Ohio, the Facebook page is the creation of the American Culture Project — a nonprofit whose website says its mission is to “empower Americans with the tools and information necessary to make their voices heard in their local communities, statehouses and beyond.”Undisclosed on the Facebook page is the nonprofit’s partisan goal. Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort. It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post. The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.Read the fundraising pitch outlining the American Culture Project’s objectivesThe American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus. The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions. Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold.

Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort. It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post. The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.Read the fundraising pitch outlining the American Culture Project’s objectivesThe American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus. The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions. Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project. In the March 1 email to Stephens, Rasmussen was identified as the project’s executive director. She declined to comment on the project.“It’s Potemkin politics,” said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “It raises deception to an art form, and it aids in the de-democratization of media and of public life.”\\ncomment0 CommentsToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyAbout UsPublic RelationsCareersDiversity & InclusionNewspaper in EducationToday's PaperWP BrandStudioEventsPolicies & StandardsGet The PostHome DeliveryDigital SubscriptionGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & eBookse-ReplicaHelpContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareReader RepresentativeAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2021 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2021 The Washington PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices  Skip to main contentSearch InputsearchSectionsmenuSectionsmenuDemocracy Dies in DarknessSign inprofileSign inprofile Skip to main content Search InputsearchSectionsmenuSectionsmenu Search Inputsearch Search Input search search search  Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sections menu menu  Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sections menu menu  Democracy Dies in Darkness Democracy Dies in Darkness   Democracy Dies in Darkness Sign inprofileSign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign in profile profile  Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign in profile profile    AD AD  homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0Democracy Dies in DarknessFirst 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions PoliticsInside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022John Tillman, center, shakes hands with Illinois Gov.

She declined to comment on the project.“It’s Potemkin politics,” said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “It raises deception to an art form, and it aids in the de-democratization of media and of public life.”\\ncomment0 CommentsToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0Policy homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0 homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0 homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0 homeHome home home  Home shareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIn share share  Share Share on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIn  Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Facebook  Email this link Email this link Email this link  Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on Twitter  Share on Pinterest Share on Pinterest Share on Pinterest  Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn  comment0 comment comment  0 Democracy Dies in Darkness   Democracy Dies in Darkness First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions PoliticsInside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions  First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions  First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions  First 100 Days Live updates  Live updates  The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policy The Biden Agendachevron-down The Biden Agenda chevron-down chevron-down  Climate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policy Climate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policy Climate change Climate change Economic policy Economic policy Foreign policy Foreign policy Health care Health care Immigration policies Immigration policies Social and criminal justice Social and criminal justice Tech policy Tech policy Biden Appointees  Biden Appointees  Opinions  Opinions  Politics Politics Politics Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 John Tillman, center, shakes hands with Illinois Gov.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTitled Arise Ohio, the Facebook page is the creation of the American Culture Project — a nonprofit whose website says its mission is to “empower Americans with the tools and information necessary to make their voices heard in their local communities, statehouses and beyond.”Undisclosed on the Facebook page is the nonprofit’s partisan goal. Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort. It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post. The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.Read the fundraising pitch outlining the American Culture Project’s objectivesThe American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus. The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions. Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project.

Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building.

A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTitled Arise Ohio, the Facebook page is the creation of the American Culture Project — a nonprofit whose website says its mission is to “empower Americans with the tools and information necessary to make their voices heard in their local communities, statehouses and beyond.”Undisclosed on the Facebook page is the nonprofit’s partisan goal. Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort. It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post. The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.Read the fundraising pitch outlining the American Culture Project’s objectivesThe American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus. The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions. Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project. In the March 1 email to Stephens, Rasmussen was identified as the project’s executive director. She declined to comment on the project.“It’s Potemkin politics,” said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “It raises deception to an art form, and it aids in the de-democratization of media and of public life.”\\ncomment0 CommentsToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyAbout UsPublic RelationsCareersDiversity & InclusionNewspaper in EducationToday's PaperWP BrandStudioEventsPolicies & StandardsGet The PostHome DeliveryDigital SubscriptionGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & eBookse-ReplicaHelpContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareReader RepresentativeAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2021 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2021 The Washington PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices\\n\\n Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 - The Washington Post\\n Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 - The Washington Post                                                                                Skip to main contentSearch InputsearchSectionsmenuSectionsmenuDemocracy Dies in DarknessSign inprofileSign inprofileADhomeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0Democracy Dies in DarknessFirst 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions PoliticsInside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022John Tillman, center, shakes hands with Illinois Gov.

Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project. In the March 1 email to Stephens, Rasmussen was identified as the project’s executive director. She declined to comment on the project.“It’s Potemkin politics,” said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “It raises deception to an art form, and it aids in the de-democratization of media and of public life.”\\ncomment0 CommentsToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyAbout UsPublic RelationsCareersDiversity & InclusionNewspaper in EducationToday's PaperWP BrandStudioEventsPolicies & StandardsGet The PostHome DeliveryDigital SubscriptionGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & eBookse-ReplicaHelpContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareReader RepresentativeAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2021 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2021 The Washington PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices  Skip to main contentSearch InputsearchSectionsmenuSectionsmenuDemocracy Dies in DarknessSign inprofileSign inprofile Skip to main content Search InputsearchSectionsmenuSectionsmenu Search Inputsearch Search Input search search search  Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sections menu menu  Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sectionsmenu Sections menu menu  Democracy Dies in Darkness Democracy Dies in Darkness   Democracy Dies in Darkness Sign inprofileSign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign in profile profile  Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign inprofile Sign in profile profile    AD AD  homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0Democracy Dies in DarknessFirst 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions PoliticsInside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022John Tillman, center, shakes hands with Illinois Gov.

Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort.

She declined to comment on the project.“It’s Potemkin politics,” said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “It raises deception to an art form, and it aids in the de-democratization of media and of public life.”\\ncomment0 CommentsToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0PolicyToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\\xa0Policy homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0 homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0 homeHomeshareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIncomment0 homeHome home home  Home shareShareShare on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIn share share  Share Share on FacebookEmail this linkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIn  Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Facebook  Email this link Email this link Email this link  Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on Twitter  Share on Pinterest Share on Pinterest Share on Pinterest  Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn  comment0 comment comment  0 Democracy Dies in Darkness   Democracy Dies in Darkness First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions PoliticsInside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions  First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions  First 100 DaysLive updates The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policyBiden Appointees Opinions  First 100 Days Live updates  Live updates  The Biden Agendachevron-downClimate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policy The Biden Agendachevron-down The Biden Agenda chevron-down chevron-down  Climate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policy Climate changeEconomic policyForeign policyHealth careImmigration policiesSocial and criminal justiceTech policy Climate change Climate change Economic policy Economic policy Foreign policy Foreign policy Health care Health care Immigration policies Immigration policies Social and criminal justice Social and criminal justice Tech policy Tech policy Biden Appointees  Biden Appointees  Opinions  Opinions  Politics Politics Politics Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 Inside a stealth ‘persuasion machine’ promising Republican victories in 2022 John Tillman, center, shakes hands with Illinois Gov.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTitled Arise Ohio, the Facebook page is the creation of the American Culture Project — a nonprofit whose website says its mission is to “empower Americans with the tools and information necessary to make their voices heard in their local communities, statehouses and beyond.”Undisclosed on the Facebook page is the nonprofit’s partisan goal. Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states. “Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort. It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post. The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.Read the fundraising pitch outlining the American Culture Project’s objectivesThe American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus. The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions. Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building. It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known. Its website is bare of an employee roster. A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post. The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019. Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty. The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers. “Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit. The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed. The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website. “Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states. It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different. “We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states. In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project. “This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold. Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb. Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics. Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project.

Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote. “By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building.

A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states. “The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues. Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law. Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance. In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan. One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown. That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts. Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity. “In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said. “There is no daylight.”Driving engagementCommunications from pages sponsored by the American Culture Project inspire intense partisan reactions.ADMighty Michigan recently highlighted a debate over restrictions on commercial activity in the state. “Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the federal government’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, are bumping heads,” blared a post.

       " 'Arise Ohio and similar sites aimed at other politically pivotal states are part of a novel strategy by a little-known, Republican-aligned group to make today’s GOP more palatable to moderate voters ahead of the 2022 midterms by reshaping the “cultural narrative” on hot-button issues.ADADThat goal, laid out in a private fundraising appeal sent last month to a Republican donor and reviewed by The Washington Post, relies on building new online communities that can be tapped at election time, with a focus on winning back Congress in 2022.“We’ve created a persuasion machine that allows conservatives to reach, engage and move people to action like never before,” the solicitation states.',\n",
       " '“Now is the time to expand and capitalize on this machine, setting the political playing field in advance of the 2022 election.”Titled “Reclaiming the Public Narrative,” the solicitation argues that the left, because of its clout within cultural institutions, has more access to centrist voters while the right is stuck “within its own echo chamber.” It says the group will collect personal data gathered from petitions and other online tools to target voters using “language consumed by those in the persuadable middle.”ADADThe solicitation was sent to Warren Stephens, a billionaire banker based in Arkansas who backed President Donald Trump’s reelection effort.',\n",
       " 'It was also inadvertently directed to someone who shared the communications with The Post.',\n",
       " 'The documents provide an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of a group whose activities are ordinarily veiled and illustrate how the Republican Party, still largely defined by Trump, is straining to connect with the country’s political center.Stephens, through a spokesman, declined to say whether he had made a contribution to the project.Read the fundraising pitch outlining the American Culture Project’s objectivesThe American Culture Project is set up as a social welfare organization exempt from disclosing its donors or paying federal income taxes but, in exchange, barred from making politics its primary focus.',\n",
       " 'The project is led by an Illinois-based conservative activist, John Tillman, who also oversees a libertarian think tank and a news foundation that recently received grant money to highlight opposition to public health restrictions.',\n",
       " 'Tillman, who declined to be interviewed for this story, wrote in an email that the American Culture Project’s objectives are “issue education and advocacy (not electioneering).”ADAD“We focus on reaching millions of Americans who can no longer rely on traditional media to become fully informed on a diversity of views on the issues of the day,” he wrote.',\n",
       " '“By reaching millions of Americans with a broader, more wide ranging set of issues and ideas, we think that voters will make decisions that will elect people, whether Democrat or Republican, that believe in America’s founding principles, and particularly the Bill of Rights.”While data collection and digital ad targeting have become commonplace in political campaigns, what’s unusual about the American Culture Project, experts said, is how it presents its aims as news dissemination and community building.',\n",
       " 'It touts transparency and civic engagement using an online network whose donors remain private — part of a bid to shape public opinion as local news outlets crater and social networks replace traditional forums for political deliberation.The arrangement “puts the lie to the public presentation of these nonprofits as public welfare organizations that might happen to do a little politics,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.',\n",
       " '“It shows the system is being abused in ways we knew were happening but you usually don’t see quite so blatantly.”Building a persuasion machineThe American Culture Project makes little about its activities publicly known.',\n",
       " 'Its website is bare of an employee roster.',\n",
       " 'A tax filing identifies the mission of the nonprofit, launched in 2019, as the “promotion of free market solutions to complex national problems.”ADADBut the problem made paramount in the fundraising documents is the left’s cultural dominance, which animates charges of “cancel culture” and “woke supremacy.”“The left competes well, not simply in elections, but in the battle for cultural control,” the March solicitation states.',\n",
       " '“The outcome of the 2020 election and the Georgia run-off Senate races demonstrate that Americans are voting in response to cultural cues.',\n",
       " 'Those who control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable in mainstream society steer the direction of the country, and as a result, control which politicians are elected, and which public policies are passed into law.',\n",
       " 'Narrative matters and is often decisive.”The Facebook pages, through organic content and paid posts, cultivate new ways of engaging with voters by sharing practical information about everything from education to voting while also seeking to gin up anger over claims of government malfeasance.',\n",
       " 'In addition to Arise Ohio, other pages pumping out content include Stand up Florida and Mighty Michigan.',\n",
       " 'One Facebook ad created by Stand Up Florida simply promises: “Our followers get updates about Florida government when it matters most.” Another bashes the state for imposing limitations on craft breweries.ADADAccording to the fundraising documents, the project is already active in five states: Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia.',\n",
       " 'It is seeking to expand to six more: Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In each place, the intention is to build an audience that includes at least a quarter of the state’s voters, the March solicitation explains, giving the project political sway in the places that matter most to control of Washington.“This means your support of our outreach can be the difference between the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate staying under control of the Democrats or shifting back to pro-freedom Republican majorities,” the fundraising appeal asserts.ADThe expansion envisioned by the American Culture Project involves raising $24\\xa0million this year, according to a budget breakdown.',\n",
       " 'That sum would cover marketing talent, original research, digital promotion, in-state liaisons, polling and other efforts.',\n",
       " 'Most costly is “earned audience acquisition” — spending money, via advertising on Facebook and other platforms, to build a database of persuadable voters.ADThe arrangement illustrates why politically aligned nonprofits have proliferated, and why they pose such a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service, said David Pozen, a professor of constitutional law and an expert in nonprofit law at Columbia University.Intensifying partisanship, Pozen said, has all but eliminated the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign activity.',\n",
       " '“In a world of intense ideological polarization where the two main parties have almost no overlap on any significant policy issue, issue advocacy will necessarily be a kind of partisan activity,” he said.',\n",

       " 'The issue touched a nerve for one of the page’s followers, who wrote: “Both belong in prison, one for killing the elderly the other for crimes against humanity.”ADAmong the most popular of the American Culture Project’s pages, Mighty Michigan has gained about 30,000 followers since it was created in the fall of 2019.',\n",
       " 'Accompanying the Facebook page is a private group called We Are Mighty.',\n",
       " 'The group’s description suggests its purpose is to train local influencers.',\n",
       " '“Members commit to partnering with us to lead circles of influence and communicate with elected officials,” it states.The group’s administrators also manage similar units in other states, including Florida and Ohio, with such names as Upstanders and Ohio Grit.',\n",
       " 'The connections among the various pages and groups, which appear specific to each state, are not disclosed.',\n",
       " 'The state brands are also present on Instagram, but these accounts have not yet posted content.ADThe connection to the American Culture Project is made clear on a linked website.',\n",
       " '“Mighty Michigan is sponsored by the nonprofit American Culture Project, a national leader in research and civic engagement in the Midwest and throughout the country,” the website states.',\n",
       " 'It describes the American Culture Project as a “nonpartisan organization.”AD“We do not focus on candidates or elections at any level,” the site maintains.The message delivered privately to potential donors is different.',\n",
       " '“We are building assets to shape and frame the political field in advance of the 2022 election and beyond,” the solicitation promises.Tillman’s assets extend well beyond a handful of Facebook pages focused on battleground states.',\n",
       " 'In addition to the American Culture Project and the Illinois Policy Institute, tax filings identify him as chairman of the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit media company that draws revenue from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that backs conservative causes and allows its contributors to remain anonymous.The news foundation recently received a $50,000 grant from DonorsTrust for a coronavirus-related news project.',\n",
       " '“This program will offer an alternate perspective to legacy media’s unfair coverage of individuals who disagree with state shutdowns as radical or heartless and will be republished around the country in state and local newspapers, which are starved for local covid-19 news content,” states the announcement from DonorsTrust, which did not respond to a request for comment.The news network, which publishes articles on a website called the Center Square, concentrates its coverage on 36 states, with a particular focus on some of the Midwestern states where the American Culture Project is seeking an online foothold.',\n",
       " 'Arise Ohio and other pages in Tillman’s network often post stories produced by the Center Square.The news site, which is among a growing number of journalistic initiatives undertaken by operatives from both parties, received more than 300,000 average monthly visits last year, according to analysis completed by the website analytics firm SimilarWeb.',\n",
       " 'Tillman, in an email, said he has “no involvement at all in the editorial decisions made at the Franklin News Foundation.”Though it declares no partisan affiliation, the news foundation has been led by people tied to Republican politics.',\n",
       " 'Recent tax filings identify its director as Kristina Rasmussen, who was chief of staff to Republican Bruce Rauner when he was governor of Illinois, though she wrote in an email that she stepped down from the role as director several years ago.Rasmussen is now a leader of the American Culture Project.',\n",
       " 'In the March 1 email to Stephens, Rasmussen was identified as the project’s executive director.',\n",
